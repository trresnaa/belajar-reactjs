# Simple Blog - React.js

This is a simple blog project built with **React.js**. This project was created during my learning journey as part of the **Fundamental ReactJS** course. The goal of this project was to understand the core concepts of React, including state management, routing, and working with dynamic data.

## Features

- **Homepage**: A clean and simple layout displaying blog posts dynamically.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar to filter blog posts by title or keywords.
- **Routing**: The project includes routing functionality (Home, Blog, About pages) using React Router.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Dynamic Content**: Blog data such as titles, publish dates, and author names are fetched from a JSON file and displayed in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Used for handling navigation and routing between different pages (Home, Blog, About).
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a visually appealing layout.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool to speed up the development process.
- **JavaScript**: Used for logic and interacting with the data.
